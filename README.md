===========

Diagrams of Arduino circuits from the Projects Book. Created with Dia Portable, with .dia extensions.
These are templates that you can use to start your own circuit diagrams.
The Arduino UNO is simply assembled using the group command.
The pins can be replaced with lines as you draw your own circuits.
